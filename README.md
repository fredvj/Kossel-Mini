Kossel-Mini
===========

A couple of improvements for the T3P3 Kossel Mini Kit

Calibration:

PDF that can be used to calibrate the Nozzle / Z-Probe offset. Make sure to turn off scaling when printing.

Extruder:

FreeCAD & .stl files to improve the way the extruder is mounted on the Z-axis.

Filament:

FreeCAD & .stl files to allow the filament roll to be mounted on top of the printer.

Z-Probe:

FreeCAD & .stl files with an alternative way to release the Z-probe (changes within Marlin firmware required). Better mechanism for the Z-probe holder mounted on the effector.
